## Description
A-300 This program is python language development of porous media 3D reconstruction algorithm, download and run it will output 300 (300*300 pixel size) continuous slice image. In the output structure, white represents the pores and black represents the matrix.

##Installation
Winpython64-3.10

Requirements
Run WinPython command Prompt in the Winpython64-3.10 installation path to install the following required file libraries：
opencv        #Enter the command ：pip install opencv-python
cv2           #Enter the command ：pip install cv2
numpy         #Enter the command ：pip install numpy
numba         #Enter the command ：pip install numba
#Once the necessary Python library files have been installed, the A-300 program is ready to run

Usage
Before running the program, create A blank folder in the path of the A-300 program and change the folder name to 300. The output result will be saved in the folder.

The important parameters for running are as follows
target_pic = '4.tif'               #3D reconstruction of the reference image, the image must be black and white, can use the test image provided on github

pic_number = 300               #The number of 3D reconstructed images
pic_row = 300                     # Reconstruct the width of the image
pic_column = 300                # Reconstruct the length of the image 
critical_zone_number = 8     # The transition threshold of cellular automata model
for size in range(0, 51, size_gap):      #5151 is the maximum statistical distance between a two-point line segment and a linear path function
markovlength = 10000                      # Number of Markov iterations
decayscale = 0.99                               # Temperature coefficient
temperature = 100                             # Initial temperature
